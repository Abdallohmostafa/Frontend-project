                  disease
                  is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19. In COVID-19, CO stands for corona, VI for
                  virus, and D for disease. Formerly, this disease was referred to as “2019 novel coronavirus”
                  or “2019-nCoV”.</p>
                <p>A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified. The virus causing

                <p>Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some cause illness in people, and others, such as canine
                  and feline coronaviruses, only infect animals. Rarely, animal coronaviruses that infect animals have
                  emerged to infect people and can spread between people. This is suspected to have occurred for the
                  virus that causes COVID-19. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory
                  Syndrome

                <p>Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website and
                  through your national and local public health authority. Many countries around the world have seen
                  cases of
                  COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded
                  in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly
                  for the latest news.</p>
                <p>You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple
                  precautions:</p>
                <ul class="list-dot">
                  <li>Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap
                    and water. <br><strong>Why?</strong> Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based
                    hand
                    rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.</li>
                  <li>Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or
                    sneezing. <br><strong>Why?</strong> When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets
                    from their
                    nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets,
                    including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.</li>
                  <li>Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. <br><strong>Why?</strong> Hands touch many surfaces and can
                    pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From
                    there,
                    the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.</li>
                  <li>Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering
                    your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the
                    used tissue
                    immediately. <br><strong>Why?</strong> Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene
                    you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.</li>
                  <li>Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical
                    attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.
                    <br><strong>Why?</strong> National and local authorities will have the most up to date information
                    on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly
                    direct you to the right
                    health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.
                  </li>
                  <li>Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading
                    widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places – especially if you are an older person or have
                    diabetes,
                    heart or lung disease. <br><strong>Why?</strong> You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in

                <ul class="list-dot">
                  <li>Make sure that you understand and can help the patient follow their healthcare provider’s
                    instructions for medication(s) and care. You should help the patient with basic needs in the home
                    and provide
                    support for getting groceries, prescriptions, and other personal needs.</li>
                  <li>Monitor the patient’s symptoms. If the patient is getting sicker, call his or her healthcare
                    provider and tell them that the patient has laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. This will help the
                    healthcare provider’s
                    office take steps to keep other people in the office or waiting room from getting infected. Ask the
                    healthcare provider to call the local or state health department for additional guidance. If the
                    patient has a medical emergency and you need to call 911, notify the dispatch personnel that the
                    patient has, or is being evaluated for COVID-19.</li>
                  <li>Household members should stay in another room or be separated from the patient as much as
                    possible. Household members should use a separate bedroom and bathroom, if available.</li>
                  <li>Prohibit visitors who do not have an essential need to be in the home.</li>
                  <li>Household members should care for any pets in the home. Do not handle pets or other animals while
                    sick.&nbsp; For more information, see <a href="#" target="_blank">COVID-19 and Animals</a>.</li>
                  <li>Make sure that shared spaces in the home have good air flow, such as by an air conditioner or an
                    opened window, weather permitting.</li>
                  <li>Perform hand hygiene frequently. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds
                    or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains 60 to 95% alcohol, covering all surfaces of
                    your
                    hands and rubbing them together until they feel dry. Soap and water should be used preferentially if
                    hands are visibly dirty.</li>
                  <li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.</li>
                  <li>The patient should wear a facemask when you are around other people. If the patient is not able to
                    wear a facemask (for example, because it causes trouble breathing), you, as the caregiver, should
                    wear
                    a mask when you are in the same room as the patient.</li>
                  <li>Wear a disposable facemask and gloves when you touch or have contact with the patient’s blood,
                    stool, or body fluids, such as saliva, sputum, nasal mucus, vomit, urine.
                    <ul>
                      <li>Throw out disposable facemasks and gloves after using them. Do not reuse.</li>
                      <li>When removing personal protective equipment, first remove and dispose of gloves. Then,
                        immediately clean your hands with soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Next, remove
                        and dispose
                        of facemask, and immediately clean your hands again with soap and water or alcohol-based hand
                        sanitizer.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Avoid sharing household items with the patient. You should not share dishes, drinking glasses,
                    cups, eating utensils, towels, bedding, or other items. After the patient uses these items, you
                    should wash
                    them thoroughly (see below “Wash laundry thoroughly”).</li>
                  <li>Clean all “high-touch” surfaces, such as counters, tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures,
                    toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets, and bedside tables, every day. Also, clean any surfaces that
                    may have
                    blood, stool, or body fluids on them.
                    <ul>
                      <li>Use a household cleaning spray or wipe, according to the label instructions. Labels contain
                        instructions for safe and effective use of the cleaning product including precautions you should
                        take
                        when applying the product, such as wearing gloves and making sure you have good ventilation
                        during use of the product.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Wash laundry thoroughly.
                    <ul>
                      <li>Immediately remove and wash clothes or bedding that have blood, stool, or body fluids on them.
                      </li>
                      <li>Wear disposable gloves while handling soiled items and keep soiled items away from your body.
                        Clean your hands (with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer) immediately after
                        removing
                        your gloves.</li>
                      <li>Read and follow directions on labels of laundry or clothing items and detergent. In general,
                        using a normal laundry detergent according to washing machine instructions and dry thoroughly
                        using
                        the warmest temperatures recommended on the clothing label.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Place all used disposable gloves, facemasks, and other contaminated items in a lined container
                    before disposing of them with other household waste. Clean your hands (with soap and water or an
                    alcohol-based
                    hand sanitizer) immediately after handling these items. Soap and water should be used preferentially
                    if hands are visibly dirty.</li>
                  <li>Discuss any additional questions with your state or local health department or healthcare
                    provider. Check available hours when contacting your local health department.</li>

                <p>The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have
                  aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually
                  mild and
                  begin gradually. Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell.
                  Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of
                  every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older

                  diabetes,
                  are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should

                <p>Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person-to-person through respiratory droplets.
                  Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food. Before
                  preparing
                  or eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds for
                  general food safety. Throughout the day wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing,
                  or going to the bathroom.</p>
                <p>It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus
                  on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be
                  the
                  main way the virus spreads.</p>
                <p>In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very
                  low risk of spread from food products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at
                  ambient,
